What is a linux link?

-- Everyfile in the filesystem has an inode (Index Node)
-- Contains all files information except the file contents and name.
-- Just like a personal ID or a passport (Without a name!)

-- They contain the following

- Inode numver
- File size
- Owner information
- Permissions
- File type
- Number of Links
